      This essentially bypass cache and use malloc instead if you are using
      ASAN, MSAN, Valgrind to debug memory problems. Or if your system's malloc
      is faster than SOC for small objects (<8 words) its safe to say Y.
      In most cases its usually slower than SOC.
      
      If in doubt, answer N
